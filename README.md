[You're running a chicken farm!](http://peck.cowlet.org/) Try to stay profitable by managing your grain orders and selling eggs or chickens. Make sure your chickens aren't hungry or sad!

* Hunger decreases happiness.
* Happiness affects resell price.
* Drop grain to feed chickens.
* Eggs are laid at 6am if a chicken is happy enough.
