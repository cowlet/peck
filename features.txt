Possible:
+ Should eggs and chickens sell for different amounts of money?
- Should happiness be increasable by other means (ruffles)?
- Should levels of money trigger rewards?
- Can you buy and place fences?
- Foxes?

Definite:
+ Adjust time to speed up or slow down
- Sell eggs and chickens from the list
- Add RIP to grave
